**The Devil Sight**


**Semantic Search of Objects in Images**



**SF HACKS 2018**


Winner: **Second Best Hackathon SF HACKS 2018 and Best use of Macy’s Tech API**



Created a natural language processing application to incorporate better semantic object search using chatbot interface. Then integrating voice assistant with the chatbot for providing  Question Answer facility related to Image.



**Problem Statement**: 
With increase in online social media platforms, there is lot of data in form of Images lying around. With the increase in these images open a field of understanding the image. One of the task is to Object understanding in the images.


**Step-By-Step Working**:
1. Integrated facebook messenger with the application for chat bot interface. 



2. Input to the messenger can be given using either a Image, or current camera feed, or a url of an image. You can even describe your Google Photos image metadata and we get the image for you. 



3. Then we take in the photo and using Vision Api and Color Api and map color and object detection. We used our filters and mapping techniques to map the color change with the object. 




4. We integrated this data with Macy’s tech Api and then did our natural language processing to incorporate meaning from the sub fields returned by the API.For example, for clothing recommendation of a shirt you can ask the system questions like  “which one has the lowest prize” and many more.


Note: All this is Happening in real time.
