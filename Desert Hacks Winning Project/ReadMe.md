**Ask Devil â€“ Virtual Voice Assistant survives Calculus.**



**Desert Hacks** 2017 (Galvanize, Phoenix)


Winner:  **Best Use of Audio Commands By STATE FARM**

Created a application on **Amazon Alexa** which survived the Complex Calculus equations with in the limits. 



**Problem Statement:**
The inspiration to this project has been the inability of current bots to solve burdensome mathematical problems. This application focused on solving complex mathematical problem of performing integration and differentiation between the limits. 

**Solution:**
The application is built using the AWS platform integrated with Alexa Skills Toolset. The computation is done using the python programming language. Database used is DynamoDB to add context awareness feature to the application



**Step-By-Step Working:**



1)  First we Integrated Alexa Skill Set with AWS lambda. 



2)  We then created a Alexa Skill Intent Model to extract the data required from the complex mathematical equation.



3) Then we come up with a over own parsing algorithm to preserve and perform the calculations using BODMAS rule.  



4) Using python Libraries like Numpy, Scipy, Output the solution in proper audio format. 

**Note:-**



1) This was first Hackathon for all the team members. 



2) We did not know any of the technologies and tools beforehand.



3) We even won the Best use of Audio Commands.


**Team Members and Individual roles:**



**Ishan Dikshit**(ishan.juit@gmail.com):Integration of AWS with Alexa Skill Set, Integration of DynamoDB, Handling of Sessions, architecture design of interaction between various services, coded the parsing algorithm.



**Prashant Garg**(pkgishere@gmail.com): Came up with the idea of Project, Created Alexa Skill Set, Came up with the idea of context awareness and  designed the new algorithm for parsing complex mathematical equations. Coded, debugged and tested parsing algorithm.
