Winner: 1) **Best Use of  AMAZON ALEXA by AMAZON**   
**2)Best Use of Audio Commands By STATE FARM**



 
**Problem Statement:**
Education is very costly and getting a personal tutor is near to impossible. Everybody can learn, time and help is all they need. This application focus on to solve Logical math problem.For Example " Sam is older than Mary. Mary is older than Jill. Who is the youngest ?"



**Solution:**
We have try to add the some logic understanding of Natural language Assistants. This application is on Amazon Alexa. We tried to induce some logical structures and integrate them with natural language interface.



**Step-by-Step Working:**



1) We first Integrated Alexa Skill set with AWS Lambda.



2) Then we Integrated AWS lambda with dynamoDB.



3) Created a complex Alexa skill set to parse and understand the Natural language Math problem.



4) Then we created rule-based Lambda function which understands the intent and solve the equation. 


**Team and individual  roles:-**



**Ishan Dikshit**(ishan.juit@gmail.com):- Back-end Development of Lambda Function, Integration of AWS lambda and Alexa Skill Set. Designing and coding rule based system. 



**Meha Shah**(mehashah99@gmail.com):- Integration of AWS lambda and DynamoDB, DataBase development and maintenance. Unit testing and Integration Testing.



**Prashant Garg**(pkgishere@gmail.com):- Creating complex Intent Model, Came up with the idea of the project. Training, testing and debugging Alexa Skill Model and Lambda function code.
